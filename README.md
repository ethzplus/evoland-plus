# evoland-plus

evoland visualizes, optimizes, localizes and determines predictable land use shifts

The fun of recursive acronyms aside - this repository will hold a re-implementation of the land use model initially published at <https://github.com/blenback/LULCC-CH>. It will not be "greenfield engineering", as there is a large body of experience embodied in the original repository.
