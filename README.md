## Overview

The `evoland-plus` R package (or `evoland` for short) provides tools for analyzing and projecting land use evolution. The package implements a statistically calibrated, constrained model for predicting locations of future land use / land cover change (LULCC).

### Analytic Aim

The fundamental purpose of `evoland-plus` is to:

- **Gather and process** land use/land cover data from multiple sources
- **Calibrate statistical models** to understand historical land use transitions
- **Project future land use patterns** using predictive models and allocation algorithms
- **Support scenario analysis** through interventions and parameter modifications

The package follows a three-phase workflow:

1. **Data Preparation**: Marshalling heterogeneous data sources into a unified database structure
2. **Calibration**: Feature selection, training Markovian transition models, and parameterizing allocation strategies
3. **Prediction + Allocation**: Recursive model evaluation to generate future land use projections

This represents a re-implementation and enhancement of the land use model originally published at <https://github.com/blenback/LULCC-CH>, building on substantial prior experience while modernizing the technical implementation.

## Development Environment Setup

You can use `renv` to set up a development environment with all dependencies.
When you run `renv::init()` from inside the project directory, you'll be asked to either install dependencies from the `DESCRIPTION` file, or to discover them from all project files.
The former should be faster and sufficient, given that dependencies should always be declared in DESCRIPTION.
During development, `devtools::load_all()` acts as though you were calling `library(evoland)` on an installed package.
This makes it easy to rapidly reload code when you've changed something.

## Documentation

This package follows the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework:

- **Tutorials & How-to Guides**: Available as package vignettes (coming soon)
- **Reference Documentation**: Function-level documentation via `?function_name`
- **Explanation & Design Rationale**: See the [project wiki](../../wiki)

For comprehensive information about the package design and implementation rationale, please refer to the **[GitHub Wiki](wiki)**, which contains:

- Detailed explanation of the modeling approach
- Database schema and architecture decisions
- Development guidelines and coding standards
- Background on land use change modeling theory
