\title{Neighbor analysis methods for evoland_db}
\description{
This file adds neighbor analysis methods to the \code{evoland_db} class using R6's \verb{$set()} method.
These methods compute neighbor relationships and generate neighbor-based predictors.
}
\section{Methods Added}{

\itemize{
\item \code{create_neighbors_t(max_distance, distance_breaks, resolution, overwrite)} -
Computes neighbor relationships between coordinates.
\itemize{
\item \code{max_distance}: Maximum distance for neighbors (default: 1000)
\item \code{distance_breaks}: Vector of breaks for distance classes (default: c(0, 100, 500, 1000))
\item \code{resolution}: Grid resolution for distance calculations (default: 100)
\item \code{overwrite}: Whether to overwrite existing neighbors_t (default: FALSE)
}
\item \code{generate_neighbor_predictors()} - Generates predictor variables based on neighbor
land use counts by distance class. Requires neighbors_t with distance_class column
(create_neighbors_t with distance_breaks).
