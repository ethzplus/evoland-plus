\title{Create change/difference map between two time periods}
\usage{
create_change_map(initial_map, final_map, from_class = NULL, to_class = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_map}{SpatRaster, initial time period}

\item{final_map}{SpatRaster, final time period}

\item{from_class}{Integer, optional filter for initial class (for specific transition)}

\item{to_class}{Integer, optional filter for final class (for specific transition)}
}
\value{
SpatRaster showing only changed cells. For general changes, values
are the final class. For specific transitions, values indicate presence (1)
or absence (NA) of that transition.
}
\description{
Creates a map showing only cells that changed between two time periods.
Cells that did not change are set to NA. This is used in the
"similarity of differences" approach.
}
