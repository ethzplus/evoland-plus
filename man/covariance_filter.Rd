\title{Two stage covariate filtering}
\usage{
covariance_filter(
  data,
  result_col = "result",
  rank_fun = rank_poly_glm,
  weights = compute_balanced_weights(data[[result_col]]),
  corcut = 0.7,
  ...
)

rank_poly_glm(x, y, weights = NULL, ...)

compute_balanced_weights(trans_result, legacy = FALSE)

select_by_correlation(cor_mat, corcut)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table of target variable and candidate covariates to be filtered;
wide format with one predictor per column.}

\item{result_col}{Name of the column representing the transition results (0: no
trans, 1: trans)}

\item{rank_fun}{Optional function to compute ranking scores for each covariate.
Should take arguments (x, y, weights, ...) and return a single numeric value
(lower = better). Defaults to polynomial GLM p-value ranking.}

\item{weights}{Optional weights vector}

\item{corcut}{Correlation cutoff threshold}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to rank_fun.}

\item{x}{A numeric vector representing a single covariate}

\item{y}{A binary outcome vector (0/1)}

\item{trans_result}{Binary outcome vector (0/1)}

\item{legacy}{Bool, use legacy weighting?}

\item{cor_mat}{Absolute correlation matrix}
}
\value{
A filtered data.table containing only the selected covariates after ranking
by the specified method and filtering based on correlation threshold.
}
\description{
The \code{covariance_filter} returns a set of covariates for land use land cover change
(LULCC) models based on a two-stage variable selection: a first statistical fit
estimates a covariate's quality for a given prediction task. A second step selects
all variables below a given correlation threshold: We iterate over a correlation
matrix ordered in the first step. Starting within the leftmost column, all rows (i.e.
candidates) greater than the given threshold are dropped from the full set of
candidates. This candidate selection is retained and used to select the next column,
until no further columns are left to investigate. The columns that were iterated over
are those returned as a character vector of selected variable names.
}
\details{
The function first ranks covariates using the provided ranking function (default:
quasibinomial polynomial GLM). Then, it iteratively removes highly (Pearson)
correlated variables based on the correlation cutoff threshold, preserving variables
in order of their ranking. See
\url{https://github.com/ethzplus/evoland-plus-legacy/blob/main/R/lulcc.covfilter.r} for
where the concept came from. The original author was Antoine Adde, with edits by
Benjamin Black. A similar mechanism is found in \url{https://github.com/antadde/covsel/}.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{rank_poly_glm()}: Default ranking function using polynomial GLM. Returns
the lower p value for each of the polynomial terms

\item \code{compute_balanced_weights()}: Compute class-balanced weights for imbalanced binary
outcomes; returns a numeric vector

\item \code{select_by_correlation()}: Implements the iterative selection procedure.
