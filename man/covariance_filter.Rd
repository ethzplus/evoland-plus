\title{Filter covariates for land use land cover change (LULCC) models}
\usage{
covariance_filter(
  data,
  result_col = "result",
  rank_fun = rank_poly_glm,
  weights = compute_balanced_weights(data[[result_col]]),
  corcut = 0.7,
  ...
)

rank_poly_glm(x, y, weights = NULL, ...)

compute_balanced_weights(trans_result, legacy = FALSE)

select_by_correlation(cor_mat, corcut)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table of target variable and candidate covariates to be filtered;
wide format with one predictor per column.}

\item{result_col}{Name of the column representing the transition results (0: no
trans, 1: trans)}

\item{rank_fun}{Optional function to compute ranking scores for each covariate.
Should take arguments (x, y, weights, ...) and return a single numeric value
(lower = better). Defaults to polynomial GLM p-value ranking.}

\item{weights}{Optional weights vector}

\item{corcut}{Correlation cutoff threshold}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored)}

\item{x}{A numeric vector representing a single covariate}

\item{y}{A binary outcome vector (0/1)}

\item{trans_result}{Binary outcome vector (0/1)}

\item{legacy}{Bool, use the legacy weighting?}

\item{cor_mat}{Absolute correlation matrix}
}
\value{
A filtered data.table containing only the selected covariates after ranking
by the specified method and filtering based on correlation threshold.
}
\description{
This function filters a set of covariates for land use land cover change (LULCC)
models based on various statistical methods and correlation thresholds.
}
\details{
The function first ranks covariates using the provided ranking function (default:
quasibinomial polynomial GLM). Then, it iteratively removes highly correlated variables
based on the correlation cutoff threshold, preserving variables in order of their
ranking. See
\url{https://github.com/ethzplus/evoland-plus-legacy/blob/main/R/lulcc.covfilter.r} for
where the concept came from. The original author was Antoine Adde, with edits by

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{rank_poly_glm()}: Default ranking function using polynomial GLM. Returns
the lower p value for each of the polynomial terms

\item \code{compute_balanced_weights()}: Compute class-balanced weights for imbalanced binary
outcomes; returns a numeric vector

\item \code{select_by_correlation()}: Select variables iteratively based on correlation
threshold; returns a character vector of selected variable names
