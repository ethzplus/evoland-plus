\title{GLM Model Fitting for Transition Models}
\usage{
fit_glm(data, result_col = "result", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table containing the result column and predictor columns
(prefixed with "id_pred_")}

\item{result_col}{Name of the column representing the transition results
(logical: TRUE = transition occurred, FALSE = no transition)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused, for future extensibility)}
}
\value{
A fitted GLM model object, optionally butchered to reduce memory footprint
}
\description{
Fits a generalized linear model (GLM) with quasibinomial family for transition
modeling. The quasibinomial family is recommended over binomial as it better
handles overdispersion in the data.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Uses quasibinomial family to handle overdispersion
\item Automatically detects predictor columns (those starting with "id_pred_")
\item Applies butcher::butcher() if the package is available to reduce model size
}
}
